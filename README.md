# Example of using ESP HomeKit SDK from WDI2022

This example firmware that creates HomeKit compatible accessory using Espressif HomekKit SDK and their ESP-IDF RTOS environment. More info on using these tools can be found here: https://github.com/espressif/esp-homekit-sdk 

This code works on WeMos mini ESP8266 board with DHT11 and relay shields. It sets a HomeKit accessory with several services as Fan, Temperature and Humidity, as well as provides some internal logic to demonstrate way to feedback external events to HomeKit accessory using HAP protocol.

The example was created during presentation on Warsaw IT Days 2022 (Warszawskie Dni Informatyki 2022): https://warszawskiedniinformatyki.pl/en/
